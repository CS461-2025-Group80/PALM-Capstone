Hello @Rahul Khanna!

The Capstone project has requirements on reporting what we’re up to and the details of the project we’re working on. The questions here are intended to get answers that pertain to those requirements. Please let us know if there’s anything that we should redact or explicitly NOT mention to the Capstone course (in the case of intellectual property concerns).

1. Does the project have anybody additional that will be working with the robots beyond REVOBOTS pilots and engineers?

    - For example, will there be someone managing charging stations on-campus, working alongside the robots, etc?

2. What would you say are explicit measurements of success of the project?

    - For example, would that be if the robot maintains autonomy with little human interaction, if it successfully reports a violating car, if it can successfully scan license plates, etc?

3. Are there any major requirements or nonfunctional requirements that we should be aware of outside of what has already been told to the team?

4. Is there anything that we should be explicitly avoiding in the project?

    - Outside of basic criteria (such as avoiding getting hit by cars), is there anything in particular that we should avoid doing?

5. What would you say are the requirements of each team member?

    - Right now, we have Justice assigned to ROS2, Luke to Unity, and Andrew on BLOB. Is there any additional expectation or requirement for each team member?
    
6. Privacy of REVOBOTS's work is critical-- it's absolutely worth noting that we also were encouraged to use AI as much as we can to vibe-code. How would you like for us to use AI without exposing secret things of REVOBOTS?

7. Is the OSU posting of the PALM project up-to-date and something that we can reliably cite (https://eecs.engineering.oregonstate.edu/capstone/submission/pages/viewSingleProject.php?id=mYO0336z0Uyv9SkW)?
