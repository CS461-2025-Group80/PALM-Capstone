## Problem Statement & Scope

The project PALM project entails creating and training an AI pilot for use in the OS of a REVOBOTS robot. The AI pilot will travel on college campuses and travel to parking lots and spots and will correctly identify parking violations and report them to a REVOBOTS server that will communicate with the college's parking enforcement. Additionally, the AI should be capable of using its robotic arm to deliver and move packages on-campus.

### Users

#### Primary Users

A primary user of the PALM project will be the college campus parking enforcement organization/group. This organization will directly receive input from PALM-equipped robots regarding parking violations, including those vehicles' license plates and time of the violation, of which they can take action on.

Another primary user of the PALM project will be on-campus delivery services that require the use of the PALM robot's arm.

#### Secondary Users

The secondary users of the PALM project will be the REVOBOTS organization itself. In the scenario of a PALM robot not being able to succeed in a particular task, REVOBOTS will be informed and provided remote pilotting capabilities to help the robot get to a more stable situation.

### Goals
These are goals that the project WILL fulfill.

1. Create an AI pilot that can autonomously navigate a college campus.
2. Enable the AI pilot to identify parking violations accurately.
3. Ensure the AI pilot can report identified violations to a REVOBOTS server.
4. Appropriately train the AI pilot to use its robotic arm for delivering on-campus packages.
5. Allow for easy passing-the-torch from human pilotting to AI pilotting and vice versa.

### Non-Goals
These are goals that the project does NOT fulfill.

1. Performing actual citations or legal reports on parking violation.
2. Creating and designing hardware for the project.
3. Designing code and functionality for scanning license plates.
