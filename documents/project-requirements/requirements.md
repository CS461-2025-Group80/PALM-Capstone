## Problem Statement & Scope

The project PALM project entails creating and training an AI pilot for use in the OS of a REVOBOTS robot. The AI pilot will travel on college campuses and travel to parking lots and spots and will correctly identify parking violations and report them to a REVOBOTS server that will communicate with the college's parking enforcement.

### Users

#### Primary Users

The primary user of the PALM project will be the college campus parking enforcement organization/group. This organization will directly receive input from PALM-equipped robots regarding parking violations, including those vehicles' license plates and time of the violation, of which they can take action on.

#### Secondary Users

The secondary users of the PALM project will be the REVOBOTS organization itself. In the scenario of a PALM robot not being able to succeed in a particular task, REVOBOTS will be informed and provided remote pilotting capabilities to help the robot get to a more stable situation.

### Goals
These are goals that the project WILL fulfill.

1. Create an AI pilot that can autonomously navigate a college campus parking lot.
2. Enable the AI pilot to identify parking violations accurately.
3. Ensure the AI pilot can report identified violations to a REVOBOTS server.
4. Allow for easy passing-the-torch from human pilotting to AI pilotting and vice versa.

### Non-Goals
These are goals that the project does NOT fulfill.

1. Performing actual citations or legal reports on parking violation.
