1. Create an AI pilot capable of autonomously navigating a college campus parking environment.
2. Train or used a pre-trained an artificial intelligence model to classify parking violations.
3. Collect a large amount of raw image data by manually driving the robot around Oregon State's campus parking.
4. Create an automatic data collection pipeline that takes images and uploads them to Azure Cloud BLOB storage via ROS2.
5. Label training data parking violations.
6. Validate and test the AI pilot in both simulated and real-world campus environments.
7. Ensure that all communication between the robot and the server is secure and respects data privacy constraints.
8. Document all system components, APIs, and workflows for future continuation of the project by the REVOBOTS organization and/or future capstone teams.
9. Create a communication module that reports detected violations, including image evidence and metadata, to the REVOBOTS cloud service
10. Structure BLOB uploads in a way that is effective for model training and ease of use including proper containerization and metadata.
