**1. Use Webxr and mediasoup to create a VR environment**

This can be used to allow greater understanding of the environment during teleoperations.

Priority: Medium

**2. Incorporate an Nvidia Jetson Processor for image streaming**

The Nvidia Jetson Processor can encode images quicker and allow for quicker streaming of images for teleoperations. 

Priority: Low

**3. Establish stable communication protocols for commands and video**

Vital for functional operation, commands and video needs to be reliably communicated between the robot and operator. 

Priority: High

**4. A user interface to control the robot during teleoperations**

A UI controlling the drivetrain and the arm's joints will be the control mechanism for the robot during teleoperations. 

Priority: Medium

**5. Streaming of all robot cameras to a video conference style environment**

This additional capability would allow more stakeholders to see how the robot is able to operate.

Priority: Low

**6. Create a system where the robot is able to signal it requires human intervention**

Creating a system for human control is useless unless it can transition from autonomous to human control in unfamiliar environments.

**7. Improve communication between Capstone team and other REVOBOTS developers**

In addition to the project proposer there are several other members working on REVOBOTS who are able to assist different members of the group and creating a mutually accessible location for communication between members and them could prove helpful.

Priority: Medium

**8. Create data collection pipelines during teleoperation**

Additional data pipelines during teleoperations can be used to train AI agents and improve their abilities in situations they struggle with. 

Priority: Medium

**9. Ensure all capabilities are well tested**

Testing will be vital to ensuring complete functionality and taking a test often approach can improve development cycles.

Priority: Medium

**10. Ensure readable and well structured code**

Future REVOBOTS developers will need well documented and understandable code in order to ensure continued development is possible. 

Priority: High
