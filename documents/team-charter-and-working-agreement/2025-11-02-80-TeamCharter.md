## Decision-Making Model

State how decisions are made (e.g., consent/majority), quorum, tie-break rules, and which decisions need instructor/partner input.

## Meeting Cadence & Tools

List recurring meetings (purpose, length, when/where), required tools (repo, tracker, chat, CI), and response-time expectations.

## Risk Management & Escalation Path

Identify top risks, early warning indicators, and who escalates to whom with timelines and evidence to provide.

## Conflict Resolution & Accountability

Define triggers, stepwise restorative actions, timelines, and how objective evidence (PRs, reviews, attendance) will be used.

## Definition of Done (DoD) & Quality Gates

Enumerate required checks before merge (tests, code review, security/static analysis, docs updates) and name the enforcing CI jobs.

# **Accessibility & Inclusion Practices**

Specify meeting norms (time zones, turn-taking, note-taking), accommodation process, and how barriers will be surfaced/addressed.

The meeting will be conducted in PST. Note taking in online meetings will be done with built in transcribing tools and AI Chatbots to create a summary. In person note taking will be conducted by Luke or in their absence Justice. These notes and summaries will be posted to the teams discord. Members not able to make meetings will be able and expected to read the meeting summaries and contribute meaningfully in other ways (such as putting more work into future/current assignments).

Every team member is expected to speak up and ensure that their needs are met. Any discrimination, silencing, and otherwise non-inclusive events are prohibited and should be immediately commented on to the team and, if needed, to our Capstone instructor, Kirsten Winters.

# **Policy Owners & Review Dates**

Assign an owner and next review date for each section; explain how updates are proposed and approved.

A meeting will be conducted the week of December 1st in order to review all policies and ensure they are optimal for team operations. Updates will be proposed during the meeting, discussed, and unanimously agreed to. If an agreement cannot be reached, the previous policy will remain in place and the issue will be discussed with our project partner or TA. If a member wants to update a policy sooner, they shall message the group in the shared discord and schedule a meeting within the week to discuss the change.
