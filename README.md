## Project Overview

PALM (Parking and Logistics Autonomous System) is a multifunctional Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) that addresses two key operational challenges:

1. **Parking Management**: Autonomous patrol and monitoring of parking areas with AI-powered violation detection
2. **Logistics Operations**: On-demand delivery of packages and equipment using an integrated robotic arm

The system features a "human-in-the-loop" operational model where the robot operates autonomously but intelligently requests human assistance when encountering novel situations or low-confidence tasks.

### Key Features

- **Transformer-based AI Model**: Learns to detect and flag parking violations
- **Sensor Suite**: Monitoring cameras for real time violation detection
- **Robotic Arm**: Enables precise manipulation for logistics tasks
- **Modular AI Agents**: Specialized agents for atomic tasks (object detection, manipulation, navigation)
- **Human-In-The-Loop Architecture**: Human intervention for automation failures
